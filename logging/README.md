# Logging

There is two types of logging data:

* **Application Logging** - application logging deals with log messages and data generated by our code.
* **System Logging** - system logging includes syslog and environment logging data.

## Application Logging

We will use Loggly's NPM module to transport our application log messages and data to loggly.

## System Logging

Elastic Beanstalk provides the ability to download log data which is useful for the cases where Node.js failed to start.

You can also transport syslog data to loggly using the .ebextension below. However, this mostly transports very low-value logging information which just dilutes our high-value application logging information.

* .ebextensions/loggly.config

    ```yaml
    commands:
        01_loggly_dl:
            command: wget -q -O /tmp/loggly.py https://www.loggly.com/install/configure-syslog.py
        02_loggly_config:
            command: su --session-command="python /tmp/loggly.py setup --auth <my-token> --account <my-account> --yes"
    ```
